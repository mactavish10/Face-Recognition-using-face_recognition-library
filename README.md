# face_recognition
Uses the face_recognition API to extract the face embeddings from an image/images, stores the embeddings for a certain face in Python Dictionary, where the key is the name of the person and the values are the face embeddings extracted from his/her images. A test image is then given, the face embeddings of that face is then extracted and compared with all the face embeddings present in the dictionary in order to recognize the person.
